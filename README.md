## A simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day 

Unit 05 Third-Party APIs, creating a day planner. using the moment.js library to create a day planner with hour blocks which can be edited and saved.


A personal portfolio has been recreated using Bootstrap CSS framework to improve site quality and responsiveness, using the following guidlines:

* The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar 

* There are timeblocks for standard business hours, each block color coded to indicate if it is in the present, past or future

* Timeblocks text can be edited and saved to local so the events persist

* on new day, local is cleared

This projects purpose was to demonstrate the use of JQuery and third party APIs.
